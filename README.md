## ‚öíÔ∏è Main Process

<details>
  <summary> 1. Traffic & Engagement Analysis</summary>
Measured total visits, page views, and transactions in Q1 2017 to identify key traffic trends and seasonal patterns.

```sql
-- Calculate total visit, pageview, transaction for Jan, Feb, and March 2017 (order by month)
SELECT 
   format_date("%Y%m", parse_date("%Y%m%d", date)) as month
  ,SUM(totals.visits) as visits
  ,SUM(totals.pageviews) as pageviews
  ,SUM(totals.transactions) as transactions
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017*`
WHERE _table_suffix BETWEEN "0101" AND '0331'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```

Query Result:
| Month  | Visits | Pageviews | Transactions |
|--------|--------|-----------|--------------|
| 201701 | 64,694 | 257,708   | 713          |
| 201702 | 62,192 | 233,373   | 733          |

<details>
  <summary> 2. Marketing Effectiveness</summary>
Evaluated bounce rates per traffic sources in July 2017 to pinpoint ineffective channels and optimize landing pages.

```sql
-- Bounce rate per traffic source in July 2017 (Bounce_rate = num_bounce/total_visit) (order by total_visit DESC)
SELECT   
  trafficSource.source
  ,SUM(totals.visits) as totals_visits
  ,SUM(totals.bounces) as total_no_of_bounces
  ,ROUND(100*SUM(totals.bounces)/SUM(totals.visits),2) as bounce_rate
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*` 
GROUP BY trafficSource.source
ORDER BY  trafficSource.source
```

Query Result:
